# Code Snippet Manager (React App)

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Code Snippet Manager**! This project aims to build a lightweight React application that allows users to store and manage code snippets for future reference. Whether you're a developer looking to quickly store useful snippets or a student organizing notes, this app provides a simple solution for all your code-saving needs.

This app took approximately 2 hours to develop, and it's a work in progress. I plan on enhancing and polishing it further to improve usability and features.

## Features

- ✅ **Code Snippet Storage**: Save and store code snippets for future use. The app can handle 5-10 GB of data.
- ✅ **Semi-functional Frontend**: A basic but working interface to manage your code snippets.
- ✅ **Dynamic Content**: Add, delete, and view snippets with ease.
